        <h3 id="sil-ipa-touch"> SIL IPA Touch Layout </h3>
        <p>
            This is an effort to prepare a touch layout for the 
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aTTV5Qe6JRAv-eKVCmNhZfS44DAN5S3p/view">SIL IPA Unicode keyboard</a>
            that Martin Hosken made for Keyman Desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
            For characters that were typed with a base character + a special character, I was able to make that secondary character available by 'long pressing' the base character. Long pressing is simply holding your finger on the character for a slightly longer time then normal.
        </p>    
        <p>
            For example, instead of typing <kbd>n</kbd> + <kbd>></kbd> to get <code>ŋ</code>, 
            you simply long press <kbd>n</kbd> to see <code>ŋ</code> 
            (as well as <code>ɳ</code>, <code>ɲ</code>, and <code>ɴ</code>) as options to choose from.
         </p>

            Other Differences:
         </p>
         <p>
            The Glottal Stop ( ʔ ) is found by long pressing <kbd>q</kbd> instead of typing <kbd>?</kbd> + <kbd>=</kbd>.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Reversed Glottal Stop ( ʕ ) is found by long pressing <kbd>q</kbd> instead of typing <kbd>?</kbd> + <kbd><</kbd>

            </a>, particularly on the Diacritic and Tone layers.  I would like to know how best to make the Diacritic and Tone layers available.
			    Right now you can access the two layers through their own dedicated buttons, as well as by long pressing the Numbers button.  Please let us know which
				method is preferred.

            After you've installed Keyman for iOS or Keyman for Android, clicking the link below should open those apps and install the keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Note: there is a known problem where the keyboard fails to install on older Android devices like 4.4 Kit Kat.</i>
